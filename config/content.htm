<h1>About</h1>
<p>此內容管理系統以 <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde</a> 作為 submodule 運作, 可以選定對應的版本運作, cmsimde 可以持續改版, 不會影響之前設為 submodule, 使用舊版 cmsimde 模組的內容管理相關運作.</p>
<h4>利用 cmsimde 建立靜態網誌方法:</h4>
<p>1. 在 github 建立倉儲, git clone 到近端</p>
<p>2. 參考 <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/newcms">https://github.com/mdecourse/newcms</a>, 加入除了 cmsimde 目錄外的所有內容</p>
<p>以 git submodule add <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde</a> cmsimde</p>
<p>建立 cmsimde 目錄, 並從 github 取下子模組內容.</p>
<p>3.在近端維護時, 更換目錄到倉儲中的 cmsimde, 以 python wsgi.py 啟動近端網際伺服器.</p>
<p>動態內容編輯完成後, 以 generate_pages 轉為靜態內容, 以 git add commit 及 push 將內容推到遠端.</p>
<p>4. 之後若要以 git clone 取下包含 submodule 的所有內容, 執行:</p>
<p>git clone --recurse-submodules <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/newcms.git">https://github.com/mdecourse/newcms.git</a></p>
<h2>Develop</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde</a> 的開發, 可以在一個目錄中放入 cmsimde, 然後將 up_dir 中的內容放到與 cmsimde 目錄同位階的地方, 使用 command 進入 cmsimde 目錄, 執行 python wsgi.py, 就可以啟動, 以瀏覽器 https://localhost:9443 就可以連接, 以 admin 作為管理者密碼, 就可以登入維護內容.</p>
<p>cmsimde 的開發採用 Leo Editor, 開啟 cmsimde 目錄中的 cmsimde.leo 就可以進行程式修改, 結束後, 若要保留網際內容, 只要將 cmsimde 外部的內容倒回 up_dir 目錄中即可後續對 cmsimde 遠端倉儲進行改版.</p>
<p>init.py 位於  up_dir 目錄, 可以設定 site_title 與 uwsgi 等變數.</p>

<h3><span lang="zh-TW"><span>Overview-</span></span></h3>
<p><span lang="zh-TW"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span lang="zh-TW"><span>In this module, we will discuss the terms notebook, laptop, and netbook, and show how all three items are similar in functionality and use. We will compare and contrast these devices in terms of their size, weight, and capabilities. Next, we will cover the components that are commonly found in various notebooks, including the LCD panel, switches, and power inverters. Finally, we will discuss the various indications that a component is failing and how to solve the issues associated with faulty components.</span></span></p>

<h3><span lang="zh-TW"><span>Laptops and Notebooks-</span></span></h3>
<p></p>
<p id="N1068B" lang="">Laptops, netbooks, and notebooks are computers that are specifically designed for mobile use, unlike standard desktop workstations that remain stationary. The first laptops were created in the 1970s, but only for very specialized uses. Widespread adoption of laptop computers did not occur until the 1990s, but today they are in use everywhere. Originally, there were distinctions between laptops, notebooks, and netbooks, but in our discussions the terms will be used interchangeably. The distinctions between laptops, notebooks, and netbooks can most often be attributed to marketing, and many of those differences have morphed as the industry continues to evolve. Laptops and notebooks have essentially become a reference to fully equipped mobile computers with hardware and software availability similar to standard desktops using full-instruction set processors (x86 or x64). Most netbooks and tablets generally use embedded processors, such as arm-based RISC or similar. For example, an Alienware R-18 or an HP Elite series laptop runs a full operating system and can support any software designed for a desktop PC. Apple Macbook Pro and Air laptops also run desktop-equivalent, full operating systems. Classifications for a laptop might include desktop replacement, gaming rig, multimedia, or business class. Notebooks, as a subset of laptops, can be further classified as business class, ultrabook, or ultra-portable. Generally, the biggest differences between laptops and notebooks are the physical dimensions and weight.</p>
<p id="N1068E" lang="">While most laptops and notebooks may share similar processor design and software with their desktop counterparts, netbooks and tablets are quite different, because netbooks and tablets use ARM or MIPS RISC processors. In netbooks and tablets expandability is usually limited to an external USB port and micro-SD card reader. Netbook as a name is increasingly being replaced with "Chromebook", which is available from most major computer manufacturers. The OS and software available is limited and specialized for these processors. Current models include the Android and Windows RT operating systems. With the power of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS), netbooks and tablets are more enticing for users because of their lower cost, lightweight nature, and longer battery life. We will discuss tablets separately as a “mobile device” in another module.</p>
<p id="N10691" lang="">Laptops are regular computers and are fully capable of completing all of the same functions as a desktop workstation. As stated above, the main difference is their portability and size. The main difference is their size: they are much smaller and more compact than a traditional workstation. For this reason, they are limited in their internal component replacement, upgrades, and expansion, and these upgrades are performed differently than in a traditional computer workstation. The main differences between laptops, notebooks, and netbooks are their size and the amount of processing power and capabilities they have. Laptops tend to have more internal storage, video capabilities, and processing power than the smaller netbooks. Because laptops and notebooks are smaller than their desktop counterparts, most laptops compromise on power to allow for mobility and smaller size. The compact size of these devices reduces their ability to provide cooling. Therefore, processing power is often sacrificed to minimize heat and maximize battery life.</p>
<p id="N10694" lang="">In spite of these limitations for most laptops, most all manufacturers offer models with top of the line mobile processors, discrete graphics cards, improved cooling, and a comparable amount of RAM (currently up to 32 GB). With this kind of processing power and speed, laptops users may experience less than average battery life.</p>
<p id="N10697" lang="">The most common type of memory used in laptop computers is the small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM). SODIMM is a good option for laptop computers, as it takes up a fraction of the space the dual in-line memory module (DIMM) of a typical desktop computer does.</p>
